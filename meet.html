              <p>
                My name is Hannah Cole. I was born in Hastings and raised in Northeast Oklahoma. I grew up on a small farm.
                My dad was a carpenter, and my mom was a nurse. Many of my childhood days were spent on my grandparents’
                dairy farm—walking their gardens, chasing (unlucky) chickens, and learning what it means to live close to the land.
              </p>
              <p>
                I grew up riding horses, swimming in spring-fed creeks, looking for arrowheads (I’ve only found one), and spending
                a lot of time outdoors. I’ve been a geriatric nurse for over a decade. I’m happily married, and my husband and I
                look forward to starting a family one day.
              </p>
              <p>
                Shortly after my father passed away in 2024, my husband and I decided to move back to my father’s land in Oklahoma.
                Since moving back to a rural environment, my need for community has grown. I have a heightened awareness for the
                preservation of this land, the wildlife within it, and the knowledge people hold alongside it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Constituents of District 86 are the guardians of a beautiful landscape. Northeast Oklahoma is a gem that deserves
                a representative committed to safeguarding what nature has endured since time immemorial—and to giving voice to the
                values of the people who make up District 86.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’m an average American. I work hard for what I have, just like the folks of District 86. I am not perfect and I do
                not have all the answers, but what I do have is values. I believe in human decency, common sense, and justice in our government.
              </p>
              <p>
                This campaign will be rooted in the wisdom from our past, and it will grow with mindful strength and cooperation for our future.
                I need a team of volunteers who can commit to helping me. It won’t be glamorous. It will be hard work. Door knocking will be the key to success—
                getting out into the community and meeting constituents face to face.
              </p>
